### Dataset

MedCaus is a causal dataset with 15,000 sentences. Each sentence in this dataset has been labeled with '0' or '1', which indicates existance of causal relationship in the sentence. Furthermore, each token of the sentence has been labeled with respect to their role in a causal relation (cause, effect, or causal connective).
