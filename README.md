### Dataset

MedCaus is a causal dataset with 15,000 sentences. Each sentence in this dataset has been labeled with '0' or '1', which indicates existance of causal relationship in the sentence. Furthermore, each token of a sentence has been labeled with respect to their role in a causal relation (cause, effect, causal connective, or none).
